### 🚀 About me
Hi, my name is Chris 😈. I am 18 years old, live near Karlsruhe *(in Germany)* and am currently still attending school. I'm in the 12th grade and completing a technical high school with the information technology profile at the [Albert-Einstein-School Ettlingen](https://www.aesettlingen.de). I'm interested in computer science, coding and media production. I my free time I enjoy playing drums and programming. If you would like to know more about me, take a look at my personal website: [chris-prickartz.de](http://chris-prickartz.de) or read a blog post from me: [blog.chris-prickartz.de](https://blog.chris-prickartz.de) (both only in German, I'm too lazy to translate them.
